# CSS Practice 🧑‍💻

This repository contains my personal CSS practice modules. Each folder focuses on a specific concept or component, helping me build confidence and fluency with HTML and CSS.

## 📁 Current Folder

- `button-practice/`  
  A simple collection of plain buttons created using HTML and CSS.  — just foundational button markup and basic styling.

## 🛠️ What's Next

As I continue learning, I’ll add more folders like:
- `padding-practice/` – practicing spacing 
- `text-style-practice/` – working with fonts, alignment, and decoration

## 🎯 Goals

- Strengthen core CSS skills through focused practice
- Keep each module clean, beginner-friendly, and well-organized
- Document progress clearly for future reference and sharing

Feel free to explore or fork this repo. It's part of my journey to master CSS one concept at a time.
